# Model Information and History

This is a geometric model representing a warped, precessing accretion disk around an X-ray pulsar. It has been successfully used to reproduce the energy-resolved pulse profiles of SMC X-1, Her X-1, and LMC X-4.

The code was originally developed by Ryan C. Hickox and presented in Hickox & Vrtilek (2005). This paper describes many features of the model and can be found here: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/491596 .
Further information on the model can also be found in Brumback et al. (2020) and Sippy et al. (in prep). 

This is the first version of this model that is publicly available, with documentation written by Kendall I. Sippy. 

# Installation

You will need IDL installed on your computer, with a working license, to run this code. There are future plans to translate the model into Python to make it more accessible.
